= Eye distance 3d tracking =

Another simple idea is to capture only the eye distance (or head height, width) and use simple tangent equations do detect the distance. Something like headDistance = focalDistance *times* (knownEyeDistanceInMM)/(pixelImageDistance)

Focus can be easily achieved through field of view. For instance, if the camera has a field of view of 45 degrees and the image is 1024 pixels large, we have (1024/2)/focusDistance = tan(45deg/2)
