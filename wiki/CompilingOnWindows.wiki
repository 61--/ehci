= Compiling on VisualStudio =

I'm also using VisualStudio, in order to compile, the following 3 files needs to be 
included to an empty win32 console project
ehci-0.5\lib\ehci.h
ehci-0.5\lib\ehci.cpp
ehci-0.5\samples\boxView3d.cpp (other samples also work, but this one is cool!)

also remeber to setup the OpenCV environment
