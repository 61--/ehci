This sample shows how to obtain head bounds after library initialization.

{{{
import ehci

ehci.ehciInit()

while(1):
	ehci.ehciLoop(1,0)
	x,y,width,height = ehci.getHeadBounds()
	print "Coord (",x,",",y,") width ",width,"height ",height
}}}

Save the above code in a file called simple.py and run it through

{{{
python simple.py
}}}
