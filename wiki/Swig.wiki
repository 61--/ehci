#summary this page deals with details on how to call C++ functions from Python using SWIG. This documentation is under development

Python bindings work through shared objects that are compiled with help from SWIG. These libraries implement some init function. They are named with the {{{_}}} prefix. This way, ehci library is imported from some {{{_ehci.so}}} dynamic library. 

According to [http://docs.python.org/inst/standard-install.html python install instructions]] the {{{_ehci.so}}} files should go to some directory like /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages or to the same directory in which the user is.

In order to make the right coupling between the library and python, the interface file, ehci.i should be properly modified.
